# Templates for TALMO Workshop

Each sub-directory contains the source code (Rmd) & the generated documents (pdf & html). See the sections below for the description of their content and instructions for replicating the document generation.

## manual/
These are the questions & answers generated by manually toggling between `include = TRUE` & `include = FALSE` in `manual.Rmd`.

To generate them in RStudio, see the instructions given within them.

## automated/
These are the questions & answers generated by the Make approach.

To generate them in a terminal, set the directory to `automated/`, then type `make automated`.

## slides/
These are the actual slides presented at the [TALMO workshop](http://talmo.uk/dayMTFT2021.html). The beamer slides (pdf) & ioslides slides (html) are identical in their content. Together with the source code, they are provided here for the sake of completeness, and to showcase (R)markdown.

To generate them in a terminal, set the directory to `slides/`, then type `make`.
